# Research Papers

## Social, legal, and ethical issues in Computing  

Over the course of my MA in Digital Humanities, I worked on two major research papers. An ethical evaluation of Facebook's social engineering practice: A media ethics perspective was written for the Spring 2020 seminar on Social, legal, and ethical issues in Computing (COMP417) at the Loyola University Chicago, taught by Prof. Nicolleta Montaner. It looks at how Facebook's constant changes to its Newsfeed algorithm influenced the very model of journalism and media, and participated in the loss of profits that media houses have been grappling with. 

## Textual Criticism

For the Fall 2020 seminar on Textual Criticism, taught by Dr. Marta Werner, I look at how literary activities in new media have led to a new kind of reader and reader response, that is not based on close reading of texts, but takes a distant second-hand responses of generating reader responses online. 

## Business Strategy
As part of the MGMT 573 seminar at the Quinlan Business School, was part of a group project that involved creating strategy for the Baumahart Center, which falls under the Business School, and is working towards building a hub of doing business at the intersection of profit & purpose. My key contribution was to suggest creating an immersive gamified networking experience using software like gather.town, to maintain engagement and interactivity in a world that is either fully or partially virtual.
